<h2 align="center"> Lessons Learned </h2>
<p> This was a great experience in working with the server side. Learning how to allow a user to upload a photo and then post it to the page was interesting and definitely a fun time. I hope to do more fun oprejects like this one and even build on this project itself!  </p>
